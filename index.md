# My Favorite Labs
My name is Miguel Acevedo and I am a student at Cal State Fullerton, majoring in Computer Science.

* Lab 6-Part 1
   I liked this lab because of its use of an if statement as well as using command line arguments. I like how the program asks the user to input the ingredients to a sandwich and constructs the statement based on the input. A program being able to ask for input from the user is very interesting to me.


* Lab 9-Part 2
   Boolean’s aren’t really my strong suit but this section of Lab 9 made them a bit easier to understand. Like Lab 6 part 1, I thought it was interesting having the user give input to the program to see if the philosophers schedules would conflict or not. Figuring out the logic to decide if the schedules would conflict or not, while a little tedious, was very satisfying to figure out.


* Lab 10-Part 2
   Part 2 was very fun to me because it also used command line arguments as well as if and else statements. 2D vectors were used in the program which I had a difficult time with to be honest but eventually I found a way to work with it. It was also cool being able to see the population of the county that I live in.
